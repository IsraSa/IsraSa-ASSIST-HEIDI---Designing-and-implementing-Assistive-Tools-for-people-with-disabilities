# ASSIST HEIDI   Designing and implementing Assistive Tools for people with disabilities


In this repository, you will find all the files needed to print our adaptation of the game "Mole in the Hole" where we provide the files for the first two layers of the game, as well as the "cards" and the "moles"

We are using PrusaSlicer 2.9.3 software for 3D printing, PLA filament (0.20 mm), and an organic style for the supports. Each piece takes approximately 9:30 hours to print and weighs approximately 160g, while for the cards and moles, the file (with 10 moles and 6 cards) could take up to 12:30 hours and weigh approximately 140g. The support for the cards and moles is left by default everywhere, while for the pieces, we established where the support will be located. It is important to consider this for faster cleaning of the pieces.
